## [Next.js Financial Dashboard Application](https://next-js-dashboard-abusayed0s-projects.vercel.app/dashboard)

### I built this project using the knowledge gained from the ["Learn Next.js"](https://nextjs.org/learn) course available on the Next.js official website. 

It has: 
- A public home page.
- A login page.
- Dashboard pages that are protected by authentication.
- The ability for users to add, edit, and delete invoices.
